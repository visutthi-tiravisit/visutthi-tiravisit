## Projects
### ðŸš— Python Selenium - Scaping website for vehicle data
As I have experienced working in the insurance company, we need to have vehicle data as many as possible to make options for client.
Well .. scaping someone's website is not the right thing to do but it is a very challenging website and CHALLENGE ACCEPTED.
This website has pagination, bot-check, scrolling before element shows, and much more. I'm using Selenium as a tool.
As an outcome, we have over 120k vehicle data that included brand, model, sub-model and etc.
